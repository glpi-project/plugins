# GLPi Plugin Directory API

## Audience

Developers (no language enforced, API providing data as JSON over HTTP)

## Quick Intro

The API allows you to :
  + Get informations on a specific GLPi Plugin
  + Get the list of all GLPi Plugins
  + Search Plain-Text through the GLPi Plugins
  + Get the list of "trending" Plugins (which were recently significantly downloaded)
  + Get the list of "popular" Plugins (which were downloaded more that any other one)
  + Get the list of "updated" Plugins (which were recently updated at the XML level)
  + Get the list of "new" Plugins (which were added recently to the catalogue)

## Glossary

### API Endpoint

The GLPi Plugins API offers multiple endpoints, the term endpoint is an abstract concept that is covering a "data source".  
The API offers multiple type of data (plugin, author, tag, ..., plugin list, ..., and much more).  
Each endpoint is associated with an URL, and each specific endpoint offers a data source available over HTTP.  
Each data source is backed by a collection or a single model, collections are passed as JSON arrays while single models are passed as JSON serialized objects.

### OAuth2 Application / API Key

You, as a registered user of GLPi Plugins, are allowed to create/delete OAuth2 Applications, each of them associated with one OAuth2 API Key.  
The terms OAuth 2 Application and API Key are often OK to be confused in the context of GLPi Plugins.

### OAuth2 Grant

When requesting an Access-Token, you are using a Grant supported by OAuth2 which are :
  + Authorization Code Grant
  + Implicit Grant
  + Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant
  + Client Credentials Grant
  + Refresh Token Grant

### OAuth2 Client-Credentials Grant

In fact, when using this API, you will essentially only be using the Client-Credentials Grant.
The Client-Credentials Grant needs two informations to be satisfied, client_id, and client_secret.
Concerning your OAuth2 App/API Key, those two credentials are given to you in the "API Keys" section of your GLPi Plugins User Panel, where you can create, view, and edit API Keys/Oauth2 Apps for your usage of the API.

### OAuth2 Access-Token

When you used the OAuth2 Client-Credentials Grant to request usage of the API, what is going to be given in return, if you provide the correct credentials, is an Access-Token.  
This Access-Token will need to be sent via the Authorization HTTP Header set on each of all the HTTP requests  
made by the service/app/client using the GLPi Plugins API.  
See below the endpoints section. An example is given with each of them, describing the tranfer of the Access-Token.

### GLPi Plugin Directory

You are currently using the GLPi Plugins service.
The GLPi Plugins service has an open-source backend, which is called [glpi-plugin-directory](https://github.com/glpi-project/plugins), whose source-code is available [on Github](https://github.com/glpi-project/plugins).

## Pagination

Each endpoint declared in this document is mentionned with a `Paginated` boolean characteristic.
Anytime 'Paginated' is mentionned as true, it means that the response sends only a range of the list of items sent by the data source,  
according to the X-Range Header that is specified in the request, with the start and end indexes specifying the range requested.
If no X-Range Header is provided, the glpi-plugin-directory's default is the first 15 elements of the collection behind the data source.

## Localization

The X-Lang header can be given with each request, mentionning a specific language code.
If no X-Lang header is given, or an unknown language code, the language will default to English.
Language codes are conventionally two-letter codes on GLPi Plugins.
Example:

 + en
 + es
 + fr
 + ...

## Authorization

### What is Authorization and how is it done in GLPi Plugins ?

In order to use this API, you must be Authorized to do so.
You're lucky, it's not very hard to get what is called an Access-Token,
in order to use the GLPi Plugins API.

The GLPi Plugins API access, is limited by the authorization system of GLPi Plugins which was developped following as closely as possible [The OAuth 2 Authorization framework](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) specification.
The GLPi Plugins API is respectful to the OAuth2 standard for authorization over resources behind services over HTTP.

In our case [The OAuth 2 Authorization framework](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) specification is used to provide an Authentication and Authorization system to the API.

### How does a typical session creation process looks like ?

What you need is an Access-Token, for this purpose, we are going to request a Client-Credentials Grant to the API.
We are using the /oauth/authorize endpoint of glpi-plugin-directory which is the OAuth2 authorization endpoint.
This is the kind of HTTP request that your script/webapp/thing needs to do in order to get an Access-Token.

```http
POST /api/oauth/authorize HTTP/1.1
Host: plugins.glpi-project.org
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=client_credentials
&client_id=a7nbqKopiTrLWtvgLTpO
&client_secret=WLvUAipaR7dOUPuqqGSTrHapJd95n0djRxNlv3To
&scope=plugins+plugins%3Asearch+plugin%3Acard+plugin%3Astar+plugin%3Asubmit+plugin%3Adownload+tags+tag+authors+author+version+message
```

(Please note that the line starting by "grant_type[...]" has been splitted in multiple parts here, in fact you never add carriage returns in the body when it is x-www-form-urlencoded data, but this is for readability.
The original text is written in a single line, without any line endings,  
"grant_type=client_credentials[...]+version+message", in a single line.)

### What happened ?

/api/oauth/authorize is the only POST endpoint we serve which doesn't expect the client to send JSON data in the HTTP Request body.
This endpoint expect the traditional www-form-urlencoded string for encoded form values.

In the previous example we sent a couple of variables via the POST call,
Let's analyze them.

Key             |          Value
----------------|----------------
`grant_type`    | client_crendentials (Client Credentials)
`client_id`     | a7nbqKopiTrLWtvgLTpO
`client_secret` | WLvUAipaR7dOUPuqqGSTrHapJd95n0djRxNlv3To
`scope`         | plugins plugins:search plugin:card plugin:star plugin:submit plugin:download tags tag authors author version message

The 4 last entries of this table are the distinct variables that were "URL-Encoded" into the long string that was previously splitted in the last paragraph.

### How does the reply looks like ?

After that HTTP-Request was sent, there is the HTTP-Response if everything went all right :

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "access_token": "xKGGWXhTCwJByv4Qp9gkO0wKmTB4pZdHnPe9ZVz2",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600
}
```

This is a JSON object. Let's analyze that data too:

Key             |          Value
----------------|----------------
`access_token`  | the access token you will use for your api usage
`token_type`    | The type of the token being given (Will be Bearer anytime)
`expires_in`    | The time period for which the access_token token is valid (3600 seconds here)

With the given access_token, you are able to make API requests during the number of seconds
mentionned by `expires_in`. On GLPi Plugins the default `expires_in` value for the Access-Tokens
we deliver is 3600, equivalent to an hour.

### What happens after Access-Token expiration

After the `expires_in` number of second happened, the server will
reply to one of your requests a response like :

```http
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "error": "ACCESS_DENIED"
}
```

### Summary: how your app is going to stay authed

To summarize, all your app/script has to do, in order to stay authed on GLPi Plugins API, and keeping being able to make requests, is to detect the HTTP code that is sent at each response,

This is an example scenario :

  1. Your app fetches an `access_token`, via HTTP, if it hasn't got anyone saved in it's storage
  2. Your app makes API requests for as long as it is possible
  3. Your app detects a 401 HTTP Response with ACCESS_DENIED as error code
  4. Your app calls a subroutine that uses HTTP to get a new Access Token with the client credentials (`client_id` and `client_secret`)
  5. Your app now saves the `access_token` in it's storage and use it to retry the request that failed
  6. Back to (2) with that new access_token as long as this one works too
